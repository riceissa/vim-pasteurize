*pasteurize.txt* Common User Access cut, copy, and paste

INTRODUCTION                                    *pasteurize*

This plugin provides Common User Access (CUA) mappings for cut, copy, and
paste.  It is in the spirit of |mswin.vim| but clobbers fewer keybindings.

MAPPINGS                                        *pasteurize-mappings*

                                                *pasteurize-CTRL-C*
CTRL-C                  Copy (yank) the visual selection into the clipboard
                        (|quoteplus|).

                                                *pasteurize-CTRL-X*
CTRL-X                  Cut the visual selection into the clipboard
                        (|quoteplus|).

                                                *pasteurize-CTRL-V*
CTRL-V                  Paste the contents of the clipboard (|quoteplus|).
                        There are mappings for normal mode, insert mode,
                        visual mode, and command-line mode.  The contents of
                        the clipboard are never interpreted when pasting.

SETTINGS                                     *pasteurize-settings*

By default, this plugin strips leading and trailing newlines when copying or
pasting.  This can be disabled with:
>
        let g:pasteurize_no_strip_newlines = 1
<

By default, mappings for CTRL-C, CTRL-X, and CTRL-V are enabled.  To prevent
this (so that mappings can be defined manually), do:
>
        let g:pasteurize_no_mappings = 1
<
